# Description
Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, accounting for about 40% of all lung cancers and over 80% of non-small cell lung cancer cases. This report presents a differential methylation analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (Primary Tumor) and normal lung tissue (Solid Tissue Normal) samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The primary objective was to identify differentially methylated CpG sites that could serve as biomarkers for distinguishing between cancerous and normal tissues, and to explore their biological relevance.
